# EYES MOVEMENT
This is a simple excercise that moves a pair of ayes in the direction of the mouse movement.
## How do I run this program?
This program has the following three files: index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css. To run this program in your local machine you have to download the mentioned files. You can open the files with any file editor, but files are better viewed and worked on in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
## Future Improvents
- Program eyes movement using other events as for example using the keyboard arrows keys
- Dymically change the style based on the events been used, for example if you are moving the arrow keys to move the eyes change the way the eyes are styled
- Experiment with other styles as for example to change the shape of the eyes,the colors, etc.
